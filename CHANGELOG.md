# Changelog

All notable changes to Portunus are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-13

### Added

- **Metadata-tag lookup.** `Reference` gains structured `provider`/`project`/`env` fields plus
  an open `tags{}` dict, alongside the existing `scope`/`kind`. `Registry.resolve_by_tags()`
  resolves a partial tag query to exactly one reference, or fails closed with `NoMatch`/
  `AmbiguousMatch` — never a guess. Existing references migrate additively via
  `migrate_legacy_tags()`. A coarse file lock now serializes registry writes.
- **`portunus find --tags ...`** — CLI lookup by tags, metadata only, never a value.
- **Boundary injection adapters.** `portunus inject --tags ... --target env|file` injects a
  resolved secret directly into a process environment variable or a templated `.env`/JSON/YAML
  file, via a new `SecretAdapter` abstraction (`EnvVarAdapter`, `FileAdapter`,
  `HttpHeaderAdapter`, `HttpBodyAdapter`). Every injection is boundary-safe (the value is never
  returned, printed, or logged, including on the failure path) and produces an
  `adapter_resolution` audit entry.
- **Semantic front door.** `portunus ask "<plain-language request>"` maps free text to a tag
  set via deterministic matching against the registry's own known vocabulary (`intent.py`),
  then resolves and optionally injects. Fails closed at both the parsing and resolution layers
  — never guesses. Ships with a thin Claude skill (`.claude/skills/portunus-ask/`) so an agent
  can invoke it as a tool call.
- **Standalone UI (`ui/`).** A localhost-only Next.js app: Console (default tab — faceted
  table + detail/audit drawer), Vault Map (second tab — cards grouped by provider/project), and
  a persistent Ask Bar side panel. Every API route shells out to the same gated `portunus`
  console script rather than reimplementing any gating logic in TypeScript. The add-secret
  form is the sole human-plaintext-entry point, mirroring `portunus drop --stdin`.
- `portunus audit --json [--secret SM_NAME]` — machine-readable audit output for UI/tooling
  consumers.
- `portunus drop` now accepts `--provider`/`--env`/`--tags` so newly-added secrets can carry
  the full tag schema.

### Changed

- `portunus ask` without `--target` is now a resolve-only preview (success, not an error) —
  lets a caller see the match before committing to an injection target.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-07

Initial release: reference registry, OSTIARIUS boundary-only resolver, Petitio approval-gate
broker, ARCA backends (local-encrypted default, GCP Secret Manager, mock), tamper-evident
audit chain, and the `portunus` CLI (`reg`, `drop`, `resolve`, `gate`, `approve`, `grant`,
`state`, `status`, `audit`, `verify`). Arca session vault storage (TTL/rotation-metadata
browser session persistence) added in the same line via PAN-7831.
